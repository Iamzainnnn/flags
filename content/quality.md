# ðŸ“² What It Likely Does (Functional Explanation):

This flag determines if high-resolution uploads are enabled for a specific user account or device. Instagram usually compresses media to optimize storage and delivery. Enabling this setting may allow users to:

Upload photos/videos in higher resolution (less compression).

Retain original image clarity and finer details.

Possibly use more data or take slightly longer to upload.
