# What is that?!

Yes, we'll be writing flag descriptions (information about the flag, how to use it, etc.â€”basically like mini documentation for each feature) using Markdown. This may be a bit of work, but we have to consider that all Instagram communities will benefit from this library.

## About Markdown

Most Markdown features are fully supported. The only exception is image embedding. To include an image, place your image inside the **imgs** folder and reference the file using the following syntax:

```
![Text to display if image is missing or cannot be loaded](image_file_name.png)
```

_example image_:
![Text to display if image is missing or cannot be loaded](test.png)
