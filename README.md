# Flag Library Sources

title: Example Flag # The title of the flag
desc: An example flag description # A short description of the flag
author: mamiiblt # Your name or nickname
added_in: 318.0.0.0.31 # If unknown, leave as null
removed_in: 319.0.0.0.32 # If unknown, leave as null
uncompitable_flags: # List any flags that are known to conflict with this one (optional)
